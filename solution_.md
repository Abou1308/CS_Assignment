- Plot Interpretation: The graph presents two different datasets with distinct Y-axes. On the left Y-Axis, it shows the number of master's students in the Netherlands from 2006 to 2018, while the right Y-Axis depicts beer consumption in the country during the same period. The scales of these axes differ. It is important to note that the beer consumption data does not specifically relate to master's students, and given that beer consumption is widespread across various age groups, any attempt to correlate the two curves should be considered with caution.
